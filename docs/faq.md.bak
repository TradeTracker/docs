# FAQ

### Will this service be free of use forever?
All features currently available on our app are free and will be free forever.

At some point we will implement additional features for TradeTracker.app Pro which will be monetized. But again, don't worry, all features currently available will still be free.

### How safe is my data?
First of all, your data is almost completely anonymous, because it is only attached to an e-mail address.

Every account that registered on TradeTracker.app has a personal encryption key. This key will be used to encrypt all data related to the account before it is stored in the database. Even if an entity managed to hack our database, the data will be completely unreadable and worthless.

All of our data is backeded-up in a way which allows us to rollback to any point in time.

### Open beta version
We have no end date for the open beta.
Currently we are still early in the development of the app.
