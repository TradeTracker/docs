# FAQ

### Will this service be free of use forever?
All features currently available on our app are free and will be free for ever.

At some point we will implement additional features for TradeTracker.app Pro which will be monetized. But again, don't worry, all features currently available will still be free.

### How safe is my data?
First of all, your data is almost completely anonymous, because it is only attached to an e-mail address.

Every account that registered on TradeTracker.app has a personal encryption key. This key will be used to encrypt all data related to the account before it is stored in the database. Even if an entity managed to hack our database, the data will be completely unreadable and worthless.

All of our data is backeded-up in a way which allows us to rollback to any point in time.

### How long will the open beta run?
Currently we have no end date for the open beta. In this phase we will add additional functionality to the journaling and analytics side of the app. Once we are satisfied with the capabilities of these two aspects, we will move to a version 1 release of the app.
