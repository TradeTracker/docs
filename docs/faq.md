# FAQ

## Will this service be free of use forever?

Currently we are running an open beta which is free for everyone.
We are planning a tiered subscription model in the future. 
Don't worry though, we are also going to include a free tier which will allow users to journal for at least one portfolio.

If you are currently a beta user, we will create another "hidden" tier, which will allow you to keep using it in the way you are using it now. See this as a way to thank our beta users.

The subscription model will mostly impact our future features. 
We are planning to create a screener service, which should help you to find trades you otherwise might overlook.
Once that is finished, we want to add functionality to trade automatically based on the signals from the screener. This is the kind of functionality that will be placed in a paid tier.

## Is my data safe?

First of all, your data is almost completely anonymous, because it is only attached to an e-mail address. Also, we are never going to ask for more personal details, except an e-mail address.

At the moment, every account that is created will have a personal encryption key. This key will be used to encrypt all sensitive data before it is stored in the database.

All of our data is also back-up in a way which allows us to rollback to any previous point in time.

## How long will the open beta run?

Currently we have no end date for the open beta. In this phase we will add additional functionality the journaling and analytics side of the app. Once we are satisfied with the capabilities of these two aspects, we will move to a version 1 release of the app.
