# Risk of loss
Quickly see what the impact is of taking too much risk. It shows how quickly balance drains after x amount of consecutive losses. 

## Compare target risk% vs actual risk%
Compare a target risk % to how you are actually trading, as a reminder of how important it is to manage your risk.

Risk is defined as the percentage of your balance that you will lose after a trade that goes wrong. An example, if you take 2% risk, then you will lose 2% of your total balance if the trade goes badly.

What is worthwhile to note here, is if you have a drawdown of 50%, you will need to gain 100% to be breakeven. As your drawdown goes lower you will need to have an ever bigger gain to reach breakeven. 
If you have a drawdown of 66%, you will need around 200% to be breakeven, and if you are down 80%, you need to gain 500%.
