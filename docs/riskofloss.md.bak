# Risk of loss
Quickly see what the impact is of taking too much risk. It shows how quickly balance drains after x amount of consecutive losses. 

## Compare target risk% vs actual risk%
Compare target risk% of the portfolio to the actual risk% of the trade history, as a reminder of how important it is to manage your risk.
Risk% is defined as the percentage of the portfolio balance that will be lost after a losing trade. 

An example: when a trade is taken with 2% risk, the portfolio will lose 2% of it's value from that moment.

## Gain to breakeven
What is worthwhile to note here, is if you have a drawdown of 50%, you will need to gain 100% to be breakeven. As your drawdown goes lower you will need to have an ever bigger gain to reach breakeven. 
If you have a drawdown of 66%, you will need around 200% to be breakeven, and if you are down 80%, you need to gain 500%.
