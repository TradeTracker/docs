# TradeTracker.app
This document will help you to get started with the [TradeTracker app](https://beta.tradetracker.app), and start journaling your trades. We know that no one likes reading long documentation, so we will try to keep it as short as possible.


## Getting started

### Account creation
An account can be registered at [beta.tradetracker.app/register](https://beta.tradetracker.app/register). Once that's done, you can login to your account at [beta.tradetracker.app/login](https://beta.tradetracker.app/login).

### Overview of the UI
This screenshot below illustrates the different components. This is what you will see after loggin in to the app.

### Demonstration
On the first login, an demo portfolio will be created to give a feeling of the possibilities and features TradeTracker.app provides.

## Getting ready
However, you want to start trading on an new, fresh, empty portfolio with a clean dashboard.

Once your ready, here is how you set it up:

### Create a portfolio
Go to `Portfolios`, and [create a new portfolio](https://beta.tradetracker.app/portfolios#new) by clicking on the ![Add button](documentation-images/addButton.PNG).

A new row will apppear:

Select an exchange platform by choice, so that the app recoginises the price-tickers from the markets you trade.
If your exchange is not listed, please contact us and we will add it as soon as possible!

Check if the default fee setting correspond with the fee tier based on your trading volume (exchanges give often discounts on fees when having $100,000 + monthly volume).

Fill in a target Risk%, so the position size calculator remembers how much risk you are willing to take.

After filling in the portfolio form, click on the save button. ![Save Button](documentation-images/saveButtonForm.PNG)

### Switch to the portfolio
Switch the portfolio from the `demo` portfolio to the new one. This is done using the portfolio selector, in the top-right corner of the app.

### Create a new transaction
For the purpose of calculation, every portfolio starts with a first transaction valued by the number of the capital that is sitting on your exchange and the amount you want to trade with.

The proceeds are just as simple as creating a portfolio. Go to `Transactions`, and [add a transaction type deposit](https://beta.tradetracker.app/transactions#new).

That's it, you are ready to go!
