Target Risk: Fill in a target Risk%, so the position size calculator remembers how much risk you are willing to take. After filling in the portfolio form, click on the save button on the right side. Switch to the portfolio Switch the portfolio from the demo portfolio to the new one. This is done using the portfolio selector, in the top-right corner of the app. You're now inside the portfolio, by having selected it with the switch. Create a new transaction Every portfolio starts with a first transaction valued by the number of the capital that is sitting on your exchange and the amount you want to trade with.

How do average losing streaks look like for you? How likely is it that you are going to have losing streaks of lets say 10 trades? With the equity simulator you can quickly find out by getting a deeper insight in your trading strategy. You can run a simulation of maximal 200 trades to see what your maximal, minimal and average drawdown is, how many trades you lose on average losing streaks and your possible future portfolio balance after 200 trades or less. As traders, we all know how it feels to lose a few trades in a row- It makes you nerveous and can shift your mindset to a less positive one. This is where the equity simulator can help you, as you can find out that losing x consecutive trades can be quite normal for your strategy. Having an understanding of your trading strategy can help you achieve better discipline and better trading psychology. It can also help you find out where and mostly 'how' to improve. Play with the settings and you will get an understanding of the effect that different parameters have on your statistics. Do you need to focus more (or less) on your winrate, or could you improve your average risk:reward? Parameters The equity simulator simulates data based on the following statistical parameters: Your balance, Win rate, R Ratio and Risk % per trade. There is a limit on the amount of trades capped to 200 and maximal 20 different simulation lines at the same time.

Foundations A winning trading system must either be designed to have a large winning percentage, or big wins and small losses. Your trading system must be built on quantifiable facts and not opinions. Look for low risk, high reward, and high probability setups. \u2013 Richard Weissman The answer to the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the trend?\u201d is the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s your timeframe? \u2013 Richard Weissman Start with the weekly price chart to establish the long term trend, and then work down through the daily and hourly charts to trade in the direction of that trend. The odds are better if you\u2019re trading in the direction of the long term trend. The more times a support or resistance level is tested, the greater the odds that it will be broken. Old resistance can become the new support, and the old support may become the new resistance. Moving averages can quantify trends and create signals for entries, exits, and trailing stops. Bull markets have no long term resistance, and bear markets have no long term support. The larger the market gaps, the greater the odds of continuation and a trend. \u2013 Linda Raschke The last hour often tells the truth about how strong a trend truly is. \u201cSmart\u201d money shows their hand in the last hour, continuing to mark positions in their favor. As long as a market is having consecutive strong closes, look for an up-trend to continue. The uptrend is most likely to end when there is a morning rally first, followed by a weak close. \u2013 Linda Raschke Above the 200 day is where bulls create uptrends. Bad things happen below the 200 day; downtrends, distribution, bear markets, crashes, and bankruptcies. It is much easier to watch a few than many. \u2013 Jesse Livermore Trends never turn on a dime. Reversals build slowly. The first sharp dip always finds buyers and the first sharp rise always finds sellers. \u2013 Alan Farley Successful trading is about consistently doing the difficult thing so often that it becomes second nature. \u2013 Richard Weissman The best trades work almost right away. \u2013 ArtOfTrading.net Emotions Wishful thinking must be banished. \u2013 Jesse Livermore Money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected. \u2013 George Soros A losing trade costs you money, but letting a losing trade get too far out of hand can cause you to lose your nerve. Cut losses for the sake of your nerves and your capital. Never trade position sizes so large that your emotions take over your trading plan. Trade the market, not the money. \u2013 Richard Weissman When there\u2019s nothing to do, do nothing. \u2013 Richard Weissman Trade what's happening...not what you think is gonna happen. \u2013 Doug Gregory Develop systems based on the kinds of \u201cpain\u201d (weaknesses) endured when they aren\u2019t working or you\u2019ll abandon them during drawdowns. \u2013 Richard Weissman Remain flexible and go with the flow of the market price action. Stubbornness, egos, and emotions are the worst indicators for entries and exits. One thing I have learned over the years trading is that crisis = opportunity. \u2013 Dean Karrys Going up on bad news or down on good news are among the strongest market tells. \u2013 Richard Weissman Profitability Manage losses and maximize gains. The key to long-term survival and prosperity has a lot to do with the money management techniques incorporated into the technical system. \u2013 Ed Seykota Be disciplined in risk management and flexible in perceiving market behavior. \u2013 Richard Weissman Position sizing can be correlated to the quality of a trade setup. Never lose more than 1% of your total trading capital on any one trade. First find the right stop loss level that will show you that you\u2019re wrong about a trade, then set your positions size based on that price level. Never lose more than 3% of your total trading capital on your worst day. When I am trading poorly, I keep reducing my position size. That way, I will be trading my smallest position size when my trading is worst. \u2013 Paul Tudor Jones Losers average losers. Never add to a losing trade, you've already been proven wrong. Never allow a statistically significant unrealized gain to turn into a statistically significant realized loss. \u2013 Richard Weissman Understand the nature of instability and adjust your position size for the increased risk due to volatility spikes. Place your stop losses outside the range of noise so you\u2019re only stopped out when you\u2019re wrong. We highly recommend to check out the book, because it will give a thorough explanation of each tip!","title":"Tips to improve your trading"},{"location":"tips/#tips-to-improve-your-trading","text":"Here we have listed 39 tips, as described in the book \"Trading Habits: 39 of the World's Most Powerful Stock Market Rules\" written by Steve Burns & Holly Burns.","title":"Tips to improve your trading"},{"location":"tips/#foundations","text":"A winning trading system must either be designed to have a large winning percentage, or big wins and small losses.
